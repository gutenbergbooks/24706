<p>There is nothing thrilling in the following
pages. They contain the story of
the life-work of a very modest man deeply
interested in and enamoured with the
science of chemistry, who sought also to
inspire others and to familiarize the general
public of his time with the intimate
connection of chemistry with manufactures
and things which enter so largely into
every-day occupations. He was an active
member of a small group of chemists who,
in the early years of eighteen hundred,
caused thousands of the laity to give
thought to the possibilities of Chemistry,
and in addition was a pioneer in pyrotechnics,
on which account he is deservedly
entitled to every recognition. More than
a century has passed since his most serious
efforts were put forth. However, it will
not be long until that early galaxy of
chemical enthusiasts of which he was a
member will be accorded a high place in
the history of the development of the
science in America.</p>

<h3>AN AMERICAN CHEMIST</h3>

<h4>1788-1823</h4>


<p>It is scarcely conceivable that anything
pertaining to the development of
chemical science in America would fail
to interest its chemists. The response
to the needs of the Nation in the last few
years has shown how marvelously they
wrought and the wonderful things which
they brought to light. Yet in the long
ago&mdash;in the days of which we only
know by hearsay, and through desultory
reading, there lived chemists with
enthusiasm, knowledge and initiative,
whose aim it was to have their chosen
science contribute to the welfare of
humanity. In the labors of such men
as James Woodhouse, Robert Hare,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Adam Seybert, Henry Seybert, John
Redman Coxe, Joseph Cloud, Gerard
Troost, and many others, the scientific
spirit predominated, although with it
went the purpose, more or less sharply
defined, of making their acquirements
useful. Particularly noticeable was this
in the instance of Woodhouse.</p>

<p>The general consensus of opinion
among present-day chemists is that
chemistry should be helpful to all. It
may and should be scientific, but its
principles ought to be scientifically applied
in every useful manner.</p>

<p>The reader, desirous of learning the
aims and ambitions of the fathers of the
science in our country, will profit by
turning to the files of the <i>Aurora</i>, an
old daily paper of Philadelphia, for the
year 1808, and beginning about the middle
of July will there encounter a most
interesting series of articles on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>applications
of chemistry under the general
heading</p>

<p class="center">APPLICATION OF CHEMISTRY TO ARTS
AND MANUFACTURES</p>

<p>There are fifteen separate papers.
In considering the period&mdash;1808,&mdash;the
age of the young Republic, and that the
times were far from quiet; that unrest
and uncertainty prevailed as to the fate
of the Republic, it does not surprise
that thought should have been given to
means of protection; hence gunpowder
was the very first product to engage
the author of the series of articles. The
proving and analysis of the powder are
discussed at length. The methods appear
very primitive in the light of
present-day knowledge, but one must
not forget the period. One hundred
years hence the masterpieces of present-day
chemists will perhaps provoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
smiles upon the countenances of those
who perchance read them. In this
pioneer contribution on gunpowder
analysis the charcoal of the powder is
often called "oxid of carbon." In referring
to the separation of potassium
and sodium it is recommended to precipitate
out the first in the form of tartrate.
Naturally, nitre itself comes in
for serious thought and the explosibility
of the mixture of charcoal, nitre and
sulphur arrests the author's attention,
for he emphasizes the fact&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"that, independent of the formation of
gases or airs, the agency of caloric, or
matter of heat, generated in the process
of combustion, considerably facilitates
the strength of the powder, in consequence
of producing the expansion of
these airs."</p></div>

<p>Recently, under the pressure of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
national necessity, which will not soon
be forgotten, the problem of getting
nitre&mdash;nitrates and kindred bodies&mdash;had
the earnest attention of chemists.
So, in the period before and after 1808,
methods of forming nitre had grave
consideration. For instance, this question,
now amusing, was propounded&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"How much nitre could be manufactured
from the refuse animal and vegetable
matter of the City of Philadelphia
in case of emergency? What
quantity could be prepared by elixating
or washing the rubbish of old buildings,
the earth of stables, cellars, etc., and
the soil of certain tracts of the
United States?"</p></div>

<p>It is quite proper that mention should
have also been made of the natural
<i>nitre beds</i>, as well as of the artificial
beds built up from slow experience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Reference is made that in France nitre
was won from the lime and rubbish of
old, ruinous buildings, and from the
floors of stables and pigeon houses, while
it is also recorded that during the
American Revolution, the</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"same means, by the hand of economy
and industry, afforded quantities of
this article in certain of the then
Colonies, and"</p></div>

<p>that in the Southern portions it was
obtained from the earthen floors of
tobacco houses.</p>

<p>The presentation of the earliest
methods of getting nitre is extremely
interesting, extended and elaborate, giving
the reader a full view of pioneer
conditions and endeavor. The scheme
of purification of nitre for gunpowder
use is illuminating and attractive. Attention
is directed to the saltpetre rock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and caves of the western portion of
our country.</p>

<p>The preparation of charcoal is discussed.
The adaptability of charcoal
from various sources receives careful
thought in connection with its use in
gunpowder; so, too, the sulphur used
for this particular purpose, and there
is recommended as a source of this ingredient,
the common pyrites so abundant
throughout the States. Among
other topics, of vital interest in these
days, discussed in the continuing articles,
is the manufacture of spirit from
potatoes. The method employed in
Germany is presented in detail after
which it is said&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Potato spirit of excellent quality
has been made in this city (Philadelphia).
It is found, not only to be
much cheaper than grain used entirely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
but to afford better flavoured liquor
and other qualities which give it a
decided preference."</p></div>

<p>Fermentation, yeast and baking receive
mention. Brewing and the different
kinds of beer are fully examined.
In those days adulteration was practiced,
for wormwood and quassia were
found as substitutes. The preparation
of beer and ale for home consumption
would very likely find little favor in the
"dry-bone" spirit of the present, much
less would the refining of wines and
other spirituous liquors of high alcohol
content meet with approbation. However,
such prohibitory questions as are
now discussed did not vitally concern
our forefathers, so that it was most
proper and praiseworthy to advise the
public how, through the instrumentality
of chemistry, many of the needed articles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of life might be made in the highest
degree of purity. In many homes
there existed miniature brewing plants.</p>

<p>At the other extreme, among useful
commodities, were the manufacture of
fish glue, common glue, gelatine, albumen,
magnesia alba, etc.</p>

<p>The several articles thus published in
one of the most respected and influential
papers of that early day&mdash;1808&mdash;had
for their purpose the education
of the general public in the application
of a science to their use, but there was
also a desire to arouse a deep and
steady interest in science in general,
which seems quite plain from a quotation
from that remarkable address of
Dr. John Morgan&mdash;at one time Physician-in-Chief
of the American Army.
The passage was&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Oh! let it never be said in this City
or in this Province, so happy in its climate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and in its soil, where Commerce
has long flourished and plenty smiled,
that science, the amiable daughter of
liberty and sister of opulence, droops
her languid head, or follows behind with
a slow, unequal pace."</p></div>

<p>Doubtless deeply moved himself by this
impassioned appeal, the author of the
<i>Aurora</i> papers exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I pronounce with confidence this
shall never be the case. Every useful
kind of learning shall here fix a favorite
seat and shine forth in meredian splendour,
to accomplish which may <i>every</i>
heart and <i>every</i> hand be united."</p></div>

<p>And then, probably overpowered by an
inner, compelling force and conscious
of the possibilities of his science in the
cause of man and the undeveloped resources<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of our country, quietly awaiting
the oncoming alterations to be
performed by applying chemistry, he
continues with like spirit&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If ever there was a time to bring
the Arts and Manufactures to perfection
in this Country, it is the present;
for the season is approaching, when, of
necessity, which is the mother of invention,
our internal resources, and the
application of them to our wants, will
advance a brilliant and glorious epoch
in the annals of our Country&mdash;second
to none but the declaration of independence.
Who is to establish the <i>chain</i>
of manufactures&mdash;to convert the crude
productions of Nature into useful
articles; but you enlightened citizens,
men of <i>science</i> and <i>improvement</i>, <i>artists</i>
and manufacturers. The laboratory of
Nature will be thrown open to you, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to use the scriptural phrase, 'Ye shall
know even as ye are known.'"</p></div>

<p>Throughout the whole series of these
papers there is manifest that noble
patriotic spirit which shows itself in
the last paragraph. There exists also
an intelligent and unselfish spirit, so
that as one finishes his reading there
comes to mind a query as to the author
who wrote thus in 1808&mdash;who was this
early advocate of applied chemistry&mdash;this
enthusiast in chemistry? Each
article bears at its conclusion the initials
<i>J.C.</i>, which in several of the earlier
articles are erroneously given as I.C.
They throw no light on our curiosity
and probably no one would ever have
known whom <i>J.C.</i> represented had not
the man himself in later life confessed
that as a lad of twenty years he penned
these papers. They are exceedingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
well composed. They show a wide, general
knowledge and also great familiarity
with the science of chemistry. Their
young author was <i>James Cutbush</i>.</p>

<p>When Robert Hare was twenty years
of age he gave to the world one of the
finest discoveries made by a chemist.
Cutbush presented known chemical
facts for the use and improvement of
natural conditions. Might not the
young men of these days, surrounded by
every sort of help, make similar earnest
and worthwhile contributions? They
surely can do this if they are imbued
with the spirit of the forefathers&mdash;the
American spirit in chemistry.</p>

<p>Additional evidence of Cutbush's
chemical activity at this early age may
be seen in a contribution to the Philadelphia
<i>Medical Museum</i> (1808) upon
mercury fulminate. This interesting
body he declared to be mercury oxalate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and cited as his authority Aikin's
Chemical and Mineralogical Dictionary.
He believed that its oxalic acid content
was due to the action of nitric acid upon
alcohol. Such being the case, he argued
that he saw no reason why the salt
could not be prepared in a way by which
"no alcohol is employed." Accordingly,
he mixed intimately two parts of
salt of sorrel and one part of red precipitate.
Upon this mixture he poured
sixteen parts of water, and rubbed the
solid mass intimately together. In time
the red-colored mass assumed an ash
color, when it was collected on a filter
and dried. In his own words&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On trying a part of this powder on
an anvil with a hammer, it exploded very
violently, the comparison of which to
that prepared by Howard's process was
nearly equal."</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>While Cutbush was in error, relative
to the true composition of the fulminate,
he at least gave to the scientific world a
characteristic property of mercuric
oxalate, which does explode with considerable
violence, while at 180&deg; C. it
quickly breaks down with a mild explosive
effect. Singularly enough, he
seems not to have abandoned the view
that the interaction of alcohol and nitric
acid give rise to oxalic acid.</p>

<p>While doing experimental work, Cutbush
was active in the dissemination of
science facts through the medium of his
pen. Thus it was in this year (1808)
that he published the "Useful Cabinet."</p>

<p>The surroundings of Cutbush were
congenial. Woodhouse was at the zenith
of his career. John Redman Coxe figured
largely in Philadelphia science
circles. The delightful and widely
trained Benjamin Smith Barton was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
prime favorite with the younger men of
science; Adam Seybert was laying the
foundations of mineralogical chemistry
and Gerard Troost was soon to appear
and give additional zest and impetus to
chemical research. To all these men
Cutbush was known and favorably
known, judging from his own allusions
to them in his scattered writings. Of
them all he seems to have entertained the
strongest attachment to the celebrated
Barton and the talented Coxe, although
he wrote of Dr. Woodhouse as "an experimenter
unequalled." It is strange,
however, that his references to Robert
Hare are few and meagre. It is not easy
to understand why this should be the
case. True, there existed local prejudices
and cliques in the closing decades
of the 18th Century and the opening
decades of the 19th Century. They are
to be deplored, but humanity is frail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and perhaps it is wisest to pass them by,
yet so many things could be better understood
if all the facts were laid bare.
Frequent favorable mention was made
by Cutbush of John Redman Coxe,
hence probably the appearance of several
of his contributions in the pages of
the Philadelphia <i>Medical Museum</i>,
edited at this particular time by Coxe.
For example, in 1809, Cutbush published
an article on the formation of
ether in this journal, and suggested that
the product of the interaction of sulphuric
acid and alcohol could be best
purified by distilling it over manganese
or lead dioxide and not over caustic potash
as was customary. He also dwelt
on the production of ethylene in this
process, attributing its presence to the
dehydrating action of sulphuric acid
upon the alcohol. Momentarily, he rejoiced
over this observation, believing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
it was new, but promptly subsided when
he discovered that Fourcroy and Vauquelin
had long before made the same
observations and given the same explanation.
Two years later (1811), in
the same journal, Cutbush reported results
gathered from experiments to determine
the value of the hop to brewers.
He said much in regard to its essential
oil in the preparation of malt liquor and
repeated earlier personal observations
upon the importance of chemistry in the
brewing operations&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"An art in which, to the principles
of chemistry, many improvements have
been made. To our worthy and ingenious
countryman, Mr. Hare, much praise
is due for various improvements in this
art, which, we may add, were in consequence
of his correct principles in
chemistry and natural philosophy."</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>Here is one of the few references to
Robert Hare made by Cutbush. It was
when Hare was devoting most of his
time and mental energies to the development
and improvement of his father's
business. He applied his scientific
knowledge to it, only in the end to have
it fail through the conditions which
came upon the country during the
period of the War of 1812. One cannot
easily forget the filial devotion of Robert
Hare to his father in this particular
business. Gladly would he have pursued
pure science, but he knew his duty and
assumed it, although unable to devote
much time to science until 1818. But
that story has been told. Another appreciation
from Cutbush which appears
years later reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The deflagrator of Professor Hare
of Philadelphia is an apparatus well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
calculated for many interesting experiments
on galvanism. To that gentleman
we are indebted for the compound
blowpipe, which produces a very intense
heat by the combustion of hydrogen in
contact with oxygen gas. Notwithstanding
Professor Clark of England
has laid claim to the apparatus, and
the use of hydrogen gas in this way, the
merit of the discovery is due to our
learned and ingenious countryman."</p></div>

<p>The next few years in the life of Cutbush
were most interesting. He enjoyed
mingling with his fellows, and it is recorded
that in 1810 he became a member
of Lodge No. 2, Free and Accepted
Masons, comprising in its membership
General Peter Muhlenberg and many
other distinguished Philadelphians in
various walks of life. Upon them he
made an exceedingly favorable impression,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
because in June of 1811, Cutbush
was made presiding officer of his Lodge
and frequently thereafter he was invited
to address his brethren upon some of the
topics of the moment. It is quite certain
that he also availed himself in his
dignified position to inculcate a knowledge
of science, and his favorite science
chemistry in particular, for on the
pages of the <i>Freemason's Magazine</i> for
1811 may be seen "Subjects and Importance
of Chemistry"&mdash;an article for
laymen in which is plainly set forth how
the science enters every walk of life.
In many respects it recalls the introductory
chapter of Parke's Chemical
Catechism, for it advises how chemistry</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"removes the veil from the fabric of
Nature, and makes us acquainted
with all the phenomena which happen
around us."</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>The offerings of Cutbush were fitting
and most timely. They aroused the interest
of his audience and induced many
to enter upon scientific pursuits. At one
place he enlarged upon the wonderful
medicinal properties of a chalybeate
water near Colestown, N. J., giving its
analysis and the healthful effect it
seemed to produce on those who used it.</p>

<p>Again, in the December issue of the
<i>Freemason's Magazine</i> (1881), he presented
a most interesting, readable and
succinct historical sketch of our science
which concludes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Thus chemistry is become an entirely
new science. It is no longer confined
to the laboratory of the arts: it
has extended its flights to the sublimest
heights of philosophy, and pursues paths
formerly regarded as impenetrable mysteries.
Placed forever in the elevated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
rank it now holds, rich with all its new
conquests, it is become the science most
adapted to the sublime speculations of
philosophy, the most useful in advancing
all the operations of the arts, and
the most rational for scientific amusement.
Exact in its process, sure in its
results, varied in its operations, without
limits in its applications and its views,
severe and geometrical in its reasoning,
there is scarcely any human occupation
which it does not enlighten, and upon
the perfection of which it may not have
great influence. It bestows great enjoyment
to every class of individuals:
and who would not be ambitious of becoming
acquainted with a science which
enlightens almost every species of
human knowledge?"</p></div>

<p>Imagine for a moment the effect of
such an enthusiastic proclamation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the powers of chemistry on the readers
of the Magazine! It would be and no
doubt was contagious, with the consequence
that our science was called upon
to aid infant industries. Cutbush was
far-visioned and dreamed of the development
of our Country's national resources.
He had the spirit of Woodhouse,
Seybert and others, who, too, were actuated
for our Country's welfare, for its
development physically and spiritually,
and how better could this be accomplished
than through the medium of
science, and in large measure by chemical
science?</p>

<p>In his historical resume Cutbush mentions
some</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"of the philosophers who have ...
cultivated and enriched the new theory
of chemistry with discoveries which
will forever give immortality to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
names, we have to notice Aikin, Babington,
Bancroft, Beddoes, Blagdon, Cavendish,
Chenevix, Crichton, Cruickshank,
Davy, Lord Dundonald, Lord Dundas,
Fordyce, Garnett, Hatchett, Henry,
Higgins, Hope, Howard, Kirvan, Bishop
of Llandaff, Murray, Nicholson, Pearson,
Tennant, Tilloch, Thompson,
Wedgwood, and Wollaston; and Achard,
Crell, Gilbert, Gren, Goetling, Humboldt,
Hermbstadt, Klaproth, Lowitz,
Richter, Scherer, Tromsdorff,
Westrumb, Wiegleb, Bertholet, Chaptal,
Fourcroy, Lagrange, Guiton, Van
Mons, Proust, Sequin, Vauquelin,
etc., etc."</p></div>

<p>To the modern chemist these names
probably represent little. Perhaps a
few sound familiar, but the majority are
unknown to him. For instance, who
would be apt to say much about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Bishop of Llandaff, who wrote to Henry,
author of one of the earliest and most
delightful texts:</p>

<p class="datesig">
<span class="smcap">Cambridge</span>, Oct. 28, 1787."<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sir&mdash;</p>

<p>"Allow me to return you my thanks
of the obliging manner in which you conveyed
to me the kind notice, which the
Literary and Philosophical Society
were pleased to take of my essay; and to
assure you at the same time that it will
give me great pleasure to be acquainted
with a gentleman who is so eminently
distinguished for his skill in chemistry,
as you have shewn yourself to be. I
have been told by good authority, of an
odd fact relative to calcined mercury,
the fact is this: A bottle which contained
some calcined mercury which had been
purchased in London was left standing
without its cork for near thirty years
without being looked at. When it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
was examined, the greater part of it
was revivified.</p>

<p>
"I have the honour to be, Sir,<br />
</p>
<p class="datesig">"Yr obliged servt</p>
<p class="author">"<span class="smcap">Bp. Llandaff</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>And this celebrated Bishop was no
less a personage than Dr. Watson,
whose "Chemical Essays" are most
charming, instructive reading at the
present moment. Students of the history
of our science will find them to
be so.</p>

<p>But all these early chemists&mdash;ancient,
if you please&mdash;are gone. They cultivated
chemistry with pleasure and ardor.
Some left visible imprints, while scarce
a vestige remains of others. Their
labours have made our path easier. A
century hence, many honoured to-day
and respected for their achievements,
will receive scant consideration, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the work of the present looms up large
in our judgment.</p>

<p>The founding of the Columbian Chemical
Society in 1811 was an event in the
chemical circles of Philadelphia. The
old Chemical Society of Philadelphia
went out of existence in 1809, with the
death of Woodhouse. The new organization
was founded "by a number of
persons desirous of cultivating chemical
science." It comprised many young
men zealous in research. The names of
eminent foreigners and distinguished
Americans are upon its rolls. Its meetings
were monthly. Each year, at the
fall opening, "an oration on some chemical
subject" was delivered. Every
month some member was appointed to
read "an original chemical essay." It
was recorded that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"any person desirous of membership
... previous to his election ...<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
shall read an original essay on some
chemical subject on which any member
may speak not more than ten minutes."</p></div>

<p>This feature was held to be important;
at least the daily papers made note of it,
as is evident from the subjoined excerpt:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The following gentlemen have been
elected Junior members of the Columbian
Chemical Society, during the last
year, after having read original dissertations,
the subjects of which are attached
to their respective names:</p>

<p>"Mr. T. W. Robertson, 'Objections
to the Existence of a Principle
of Repulsion.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Francis Brognard, 'On Chemical
Affinity.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Lewis Gerhardt, 'On Light.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Dudley Burwell, 'On the
Chemical Properties and Medical Uses
of Arsenic.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Jeremiah J. Foster, 'On the
History, Nature and Properties of
Oxygen Gas.'</p>

<p>"Mr. J. C. Foster, 'Objections to the
Antiphlogistic Theory of Combustion.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Charles Gignilliat, 'On Hydrogen
Gas.'</p>

<p>"Mr. John Bent, 'On Oxygen Gas.'"</p></div>

<p>The monthly meetings were announced
in the city papers. The announcements
appeared at intervals
through a period of years, hence it may
be assumed the Society was an active
organization and that its members regarded
it as of consequence. The personnel
of its official family is not devoid
of interest at present. A single volume
of memoirs, printed in 1813, is still extant
and may occasionally be seen; from
it will be learned that the "Hon.
Thomas Jefferson, Esq., was the Patron"
of the Society and its President<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
was "James Cutbush, Esq., Professor
of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and
Mineralogy in St. John's College."</p>

<p>Turning to the table of contents two
contributions from the President are
observed. The first relates to the
"Prognostic Signs of the Weather"
and the second is "On the Oxyacetite
of Iron as a Test or Reagent for the
Discovery of Arsenic." There is little
chemistry in the first contribution, and
the second possesses value chiefly in the
qualitative way. They were evidently
dashed off with the idea of arousing discussion,
in the hope that serious efforts
might be set in operation in certain
directions.</p>

<p>The thought which intrudes itself in
looking through the <i>Memoirs</i>, noting
the character of the individuals in the
membership, and upon recalling the
chemical activities of Cutbush, is as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the man himself. Why should he, barely
twenty-three years of age, be chosen to
such an important and prominent station
as that of President of the Columbian
Chemical Society? What manner
of man was he? What his qualifications,
his fitness and his position in the science
world of Philadelphia? A search
through ancient volumes in many libraries
failed to bring to light any facts
bearing on these points. The only fact
discovered that had any value came
from a newspaper advertisement bearing
the date October, 1819. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Bleaching Liquor</i>, <i>Artificial Musk</i>,
<i>Phosphate of Mercury and other chemical
Preparations</i>, prepared and sold by</p></div>

<p class="center">
"JAMES CUTBUSH<br />
"Chemist and Apothecary<br />
"No. 25 South Fourth Street, Phila.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"where complete collections of chemical
reagents are kept as usual."</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>Here is a hint as to the occupation of
Cutbush. He was a chemist&mdash;presumably
a manufacturing chemist, supplying
the necessary reagents to persons
desiring them for their chemical studies;
and further he was a pharmacist serving
the various requirements of the medical
men of the City.</p>

<p>Thorough search through newspaper
files disclosed that from the year 1811
and perhaps two years earlier, and extending
up to the year 1813&mdash;various
announcements were made by Cutbush
as to lectures of a public nature. These
help us realize the character of the individual
and his work. For example&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dr. Cutbush's course of <i>Evening
Lectures on Chemistry</i> will commence
early in the second week in November,
at the Laboratory in Videl's Court, in
Second, near the Corner of Chestnut St."</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>and several months later the following
notice was found&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"<i>LECTURES</i><br />
on<br />
<i>THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL PHARMACY</i><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The subscriber, at the solicitation of
several medical gentlemen, proposes to
give a series of Lectures on the Theory
and Practice of Pharmacy, accompanied
with the necessary chemical
elucidations.</p>

<p>"Tickets may be had at 25 South
Fourth St.</p>

<p>"Price 20 dollars.</p></div>

<p class="author">
"<span class="smcap">James Cutbush.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>This was in the year 1812. Early in
1813, a year after the preceding announcement,
there appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"J. Cutbush has the pleasure to announce
to the ladies and gentlemen composing
his class that the lectures on
Chemistry, as well as those which are to
follow on Mineralogy and Natural
Philosophy, will be given in St. John's
Lyceum in a building lately erected at
the Corner of Chester and Race, between
Eighth and Ninth Sts.</p>

<p>"N.B. The next lecture will be delivered
this evening (Saturday) when,
at the request of several ladies, the
nitrous oxide or the exhilarating gas
will be exhibited."</p></div>

<p>These announcements exhibit a phase
in the development of chemical science
which is worthy of pause and reflection.
Science subjects had taken hold of many
persons in the early years of the Nineteenth
Century. Some of them became
ardent enthusiasts and missioners in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
extension of those subjects. As early as
1808 M. Godon gave lectures on Mineralogy,
and in 1810 announced a work
of two volumes with a quarto supplement
of charts. The science of chemistry
also had its advocates. Cutbush
was evidently one of them, although not
the first. This honor belongs to Dr.
Patrick Kerr Rogers, father of William
B. Rogers, founder and first president
of Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and President of the National Academy
of Science, of Dr. Henry D.
Rogers, the eminent geologist, and of
James B. and Robert E.&mdash;both distinguished
in the chemical field.</p>

<p>It was in 1802 that Patrick K.
Rogers received his medical degree and
embarked upon practice. Having spare
time, he began public lectures on the
sciences, confining himself from 1807 to
chemistry. He was very successful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
One of his advertisements as it appeared
in the <i>Aurora</i>, in 1809, read:</p>

<p class="center">
"EVENING LECTURES<br />
MEDICAL AND CHEMICAL<br />
For Gentlemen<br />
<br />
DR. P. K. ROGERS<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Having commenced a course of experimental
lectures on Chemistry to
ladies, proposes to give a similar course
to gentlemen at a different hour.
Twelve o'clock is the hour fixed for the
former, but as the gentlemen of the city
are variously engaged in business during
the day, an evening hour will be more
convenient for them. The evening
course is particularly intended to accommodate
men who have a taste for
scientific information and who cannot,
on account of their respective engagements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
during the day, attend the lectures
in the University.</p>

<p>"A course for gentlemen will commence
on Tuesday and will terminate in
the last week of February. The hour
will be seven o'clock in the evening.
Two lectures at least, sometimes three,
will be delivered every week. About
1500 interesting experiments will be
exhibited and submitted to the familiar
inspection of the class. Several important
experiments not hitherto introduced
in any series of chemical
demonstrations in this place will be displayed
in the illustrations of different
subjects.</p>

<p>"The laboratory is in the lecturer's
house in South Ninth Street, opposite
the University and is furnished with an
excellent chemical apparatus.</p>

<p>"The tickets for this course will be
ten dollars. The persons to take tickets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
will be entitled to the use of the lecturer's
excellent medical and chemical
library during the season.</p>

<p>"Persons wishing to attend this
course will please call at the lecturer's
home at any time before next Tuesday
in order to enter the names on the list.</p>

<p>"Ladies are informed that the list of
subscribers to their course will not be
closed until next Monday at twelve
o'clock at the hour the next lecture,
properly the first of the regular series,
will be delivered. Gentlemen are not
admitted to these lectures."</p></div>

<p>In 1810 Dr. Rogers gave out a Syllabus
of 12 octavo pages "On Experimental
Lectures on Natural Philosophy
and Chemistry," in which great emphasis
was laid on the practical application of
these sciences. It also stated that "it
is even esteemed, in some measure, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
cause of shame, for persons of respectable
education, to be ignorant of their
general principles." In one newspaper
announcement Rogers said that in order
to get sufficient space for his audience
he had procured the "use of the elegant
and spacious ball room of M. Guillou."
In this special work he was repeating
the labors of Sir Humphrey Davy in
London. In reality, Rogers and his contemporaries
and coadjutors were pioneer
University Extension Lecturers.
They sought to popularize the natural
and physical sciences and also broaden
the vision or outlook of their hearers.
In the case of Cutbush there was a
strong desire to utilize chemistry in
manufacture. This he emphasized more
strongly than any other lecturer.</p>

<p>Another participant in the science
propaganda was Dr. Thomas P. Jones,
who devoted himself to Chemistry. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
following notice of his lecture course is
not devoid of interest:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On Saturday, the 13th inst., at
seven o'clock in the evening, at Dr.
Jones' Chemical Lecture Room, S.W.
Corner of Fourth and Chestnut Streets,
a lecture will be delivered on the properties
of nitrous oxide, or the exhilarating
gas, accompanied with a number of
experiments. A large quantity will
be prepared to exhibit its effects
when inhaled.</p>

<p>"Tickets at fifty cents each may be
had at A. Finley's Bookstore, S.E. Cor.
of Chestnut and Fourth Streets, or at
the lecture room on the stated evening."</p></div>

<p>On perusing early chemical texts and
advertisements, such as those just given,
attention is pointedly called to nitrous
oxide, especially to its exhilarating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
properties, for then it was "<i>laughing
gas</i>!" One Philip H. Nicklin published
a brochure entitled</p>

<p class="center">"THE ONLY GENTEEL WAY OF
GETTING DRUNK</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A character representation of the
effects produced by inhaling nitrous
oxide gas. The accuracy of which no
man breathing can deny. Price 25&nbsp;cts."</p></div>

<p>To-day, nitrous oxide means a benign
an&aelig;sthetic, so helpful and merciful
when one is brought under the knife of
the skillful surgeon.</p>

<p>The honor accorded Cutbush by his
election to the Presidency of the Columbian
Chemical Society was merited. He
was not only an active, intelligent chemist,
devoted to the advancement of his
science in all directions, but he seems
to have been an ardent enthusiast in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
cause of education, for on the 7th of
November, 1811, he delivered an Oration
on Education before the Society for
the Promotion of a Rational System of
Education. His audience was large and
consisted of the very best people of the
city. The printed oration shows that
in addition to his chemical knowledge
he was versed in the humanities, in
mathematics, in philosophy and ancient
history. To-day the intelligent reader
would pronounce the oration scholarly
in every particular. His chief purpose
seems to have been to introduce into
what was then the customary curriculum
in schools a definite amount of
science&mdash;natural and physical. This is
marked in the title of the organization
before which he appeared on the occasion
referred to, in Old St. John's
Church. The whole community was interested
in education. A society of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
educators had existed for a number of
years. Neef had for a long time been
advocating a system which was in reality
a modification of the Pestallozian
System, and men in every walk of life
were seriously considering the innovations
and advancements in this all-important
subject.</p>

<p>Little can be found in regard to the
Society for the Promotion of a Rational
System of Education, but it may be inferred
that the society had branches
throughout the city and perhaps far
beyond, because elsewhere Cutbush
spoke of the society as under the Presidency
of John Goodman, Esq., and that
its purpose was to bring about a reformation
in education. Further, Goodman
was a prominent layman in the
Church of Old St. John, who with his
associates, Messrs. Greiner and Braeutigam,
fellow churchmen, deeply impressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
with the new thought, seem to have
established a school "formed out of the
Lutheran congregation of the Church
of St. John ... instituted several
professorships ... one of which,
that of Chemistry, Mineralogy and
Natural Philosophy" was conferred
upon Cutbush, who proceeded to deliver
courses on these subjects.</p>

<p>Desirous of learning something in regard
to St. John's College, the authorities
of St. John's Lutheran Church
were consulted. It must be remembered
that this is the oldest English-speaking
Lutheran Church in America. It was
founded by General Peter Gabriel
Muhlenberg, and a unique distinction of
this church is that in a period of 113
years it has had but three pastors.
Nothing in the minutes of the church
showed that a movement toward the
establishment of a college had ever been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
made. Moreover, search in the archives
of the State Department failed to bring
to light the granting of a charter for
an institution bearing the name of St.
John's College, although in an old directory
of Philadelphia, reference is made
to St. John's College, and to the fact
that Cutbush was Professor of Chemistry,
Mineralogy and Natural Philosophy
in it. The same source of
information declared that "the lectures
were held back of St. John's Church in
Race Street." It may be questioned
whether Messrs. Goodman, Greiner and
Braeutigam, who were the leaders of the
congregation in the early years of 1800,
and enthusiasts in regard to the reformation
in education, did not, perhaps,
carry out their thought without
consulting the rest of their church associates.
In the history of the church
there is a singular reference to the purchase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of houses and lots which were
known as "the fourteen chimneys" and
the statement is made that the object
of the purchase is not given. These
"fourteen chimneys" may have been
the buildings back of St. John's Church
on Race Street.</p>

<p>Benjamin Smith Barton was another
professor in St. John's College, who devoted
himself to Natural History and
Botany. Mr. Greiner, who was associated
with Messrs. Goodman and
Braeutigam also taught in the institution,
and the head of the college or
school was a Mr. Bachman, who later
became a Lutheran clergyman and naturalist
of high repute in South Carolina.</p>

<p>It is interesting at this far-away day
to note the purposes of the Society for
the promotion of education as set forth
in its constitution. Among other things,
it is said "the education of youth in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
useful knowledge ought to be a primary
object with parents and friends, that
more especially ought every endeavour
to be made in a religious community to
lay a sure and solid foundation for
every moral and social virtue. Impressed
with a conviction of this important
truth, a number of the members
of St. John's congregation, willing to
give every aid within their power toward
the establishment and support of a
Rational System of Education, have
formed themselves into a Society for
that purpose."</p>

<p>The copy of Oration on Education,
printed by Cutbush, which it was the
privilege of the writer to peruse, was
the copy handed by Cutbush "To Dr.
Seybert with the compliments of the
author." In spite of age, these words
are very clear and legible, and if the
only relic by which to judge of the character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of Cutbush, would indicate him
to be a man of intelligence.</p>

<p>There were many other societies extant
at this period and through subsequent
years which had for their object
the promotion of scientific education.
Among these was the Linnean Society,
of which James Cutbush was
Vice-President.</p>

<p>Cutbush had the honor of being one
of the few of the original Society of
Philadelphia for the Promotion of National
Industry, whose essays excited
the attention of the citizens of the
United States. Samuel Jackson, M.D.,
Professor in the College of Apothecaries,
was one of the most active members.</p>

<p>Amidst all the activities of Cutbush
as a manufacturing chemist, as a
teacher of the science, as a promoter of
educational reforms, as a member of
many organizations, he was very busy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
in a literary direction. For example, in
1812 he published a brochure on Hydrostatics,
in which were described various
hydrometers and their application.
Numerous tables appear in it as well as
many interesting and serviceable problems.
It was designed for and was
helpful to artisans and to beginners in
the science of physics and chemistry. It
is appropriately dedicated to the Columbian
Chemical Society.</p>

<p>In the year 1813, Cutbush placed before
the public his "Philosophy of Experimental
Chemistry" in two volumes.
It was dedicated to the "Professors and
Students of the University of Pennsylvania
and to the Trustees of St. John's
College." One cannot fail to wonder
why Cutbush should have so honoured
the University when there is no record
anywhere that he ever pursued studies
under the &aelig;gis of the University. Indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
it will probably remain a query as
to where he was educated. He is often
spoken of as "Doctor Cutbush" and
in at least two instances the title "M.D."
is placed after his name, yet it is a fact
that in no place where he personally was
responsible for the printing of his name
is there any title affixed to it. Every
source of information from which it was
hoped to ascertain where Cutbush might
have obtained the Doctorate in the first
decade of the 19th Century failed to
produce the fact. Libraries were
searched and volumes that ordinarily
convey such information were studied
without positive result.</p>

<p>The little contribution on the "Philosophy
of Chemistry" was favorably
known, for Silliman, in his reference to
Gorham's Chemistry as the first book
upon this subject by a native American,
credits Cutbush with having written a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
similar work, but speaks of the effort of
Cutbush as more elementary and not as
exhaustive as that of Gorham. The
introduction in the first volume of Cutbush's
work will always be interesting
to American students of the science.
For example, this quotation:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Several original works have, accordingly,
appeared, and some editions
of European treatises have been published
with revisions, corrections and
additions by our countrymen. The
Chemical and Economical Essays of
Pennington, the edition of Chaptal enlarged
by the late James Woodhouse
... that of Henry's Chemistry by
Professor Silliman of Yale College, with
some others, evince not only the learning
and talents of our countrymen, but a
growing taste for the encouragement of
learning and the acquisition of chemical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
knowledge. Besides these, in the Transactions
of our Societies and in the journals,
or periodical works, several valuable
papers have appeared. The genius
of the medical students of the University
of Pennsylvania, in particular, has been
shown in a number of excellent inaugural
dissertations, some of which have
added to the improvement of chemical
science.</p>

<p>"The first teacher of chemistry was
Dr. Benjamin Rush ... who may
justly be styled the father of chemistry
in America. He commenced a course of
lectures on this science in the then College
of Philadelphia; and although
chemistry at that day (1768) may be
said to have been in its infancy, yet the
Doctor did honour to the chair, the
school, and his country. We now speak
of him only as a chemist.... The
advancement of chemistry in our city<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
... is also indebted to other institutions.
The American Philosophical
Society, the College of Physicians, instituted
in 1787, the Medical Society,
formed in 1771; the Chemical Society
under the patronage of Doctors Woodhouse
and Seybert, which has since been
dissolved; the Linnean Society, instituted
under the presidency of the
learned Dr. Benjamin Smith Barton;
the Columbian Chemical Society,
founded in 1811; the Academy of
Natural Science&mdash;all show the zeal for
useful knowledge and philosophical
inquiry.... For the introduction
of popular chemistry, the citizens of
Philadelphia are also indebted to Doctors
Rogers and Jones, and to Benjamin
Tucker, who have taught Chemistry
with much zeal and talents."</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>Many attractions are found in the
Philosophy of Experimental Chemistry.
The first discussion is that on Chemical
Affinity. Two experiments are introduced.
In the first it is stated</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If equal parts, by weight, of sulphur
and mercury be introduced into a crucible,
and in this situation exposed to a
sufficient heat; a compound will be
formed, called sulphuret of mercury."</p></div>

<p>In the second experiment the student
is advised to</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mix together sulphur and potash, and
throw them into water; the sulphur will
separate. If the same articles be put
into a crucible and melted, and then
thrown into water, the sulphur as well
as the potash will be dissolved."</p></div>

<p>And next comes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Rationale.</i> In the first experiment
there is an instance of chemical action,
as well as of single affinity, for the
sulphur and mercury would remain separate
if heat was not applied. In consequence
of this agent, they unite into
an uniform whole, totally inseparable
by mechanical means, and possessing
characters distinct from either of its
constituent parts.</p>

<p>"In the second experiment, the union
of sulphur with potash is effected by
heat; for if a sulphuret was not formed,
no solution of the sulphur would take
place. Hence it is that chemical action
is the consequence of a power, without
which it could never ensue, and with
which it always acts in unison. This
power is affinity."</p></div>

<p>Then it is remarked:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Chemistry is a science, which has
for its object to discover the constituent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
properties of bodies, the result of the
various combinations, and the laws by
which those combinations are effected.
Its operations being either analytical or
synthetical, consist of composition, or
decomposition. The laws which govern
chemical changes have been resolved into
those of attraction or affinity. Affinity
of composition of chemical affinity differs
from that of aggregation or cohesion
or corpuscular attraction, by acting
upon matter of a different kind; or by
taking place between the ultimate constituent
parts of bodies, producing by
its action, substances possessing properties
frequently very different, and
sometimes contrary to those of the
constituent parts."</p></div>

<p>Throughout the book the order of
presentation is the experiment, rationale,
and remarks. A study of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
"Philosophy" shows clearly that Cutbush
presented his material in a rather
original fashion. His method is not
observable in any of the text-books of
that date.</p>

<p>In discussing potash, Cutbush wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It has been supposed ever since our
countryman, Dr. Woodhouse, made an
experiment with potash that this alkali
had an inflammable base. I am disposed
to believe that the Doctor was the first
one who hazarded this conjecture as to
the inflammable nature of potash <i>when
treated in certain ways</i>. The Doctor
found that a mixture of pearl ash with
soot, calcined by a very intense heat in
a covered crucible, when cold caught
fire on the affusion of water. The experiment
was repeated with charcoal
with the same result and the inflammation
probably arose from the action of
the base of the alkali on the water."</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That Thomas Cooper ... repeated
this experiment, and succeeded,
I think, after several attempts, in procuring
the metal. Dr. John Redman
Coxe and myself also performed it, but
in our attempt we failed. The professor,
however, persevered, and finally
procured it.... My brother, Dr.
Edward Cutbush, succeeded in procuring
it by using the heat of a black-smith's
forge. I have not heard of any
other attempts in this country except
by a gentleman in New York, who was
also successful."</p></div>

<p>These statements substantiate the
idea that Woodhouse isolated the metal
potassium quite independently from any
European chemist; it even looks as if
he may have isolated it in the manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
referred to before Sir Humphrey Davy
had separated it with the aid of the
electric current.</p>

<p>In the first volume of the Philosophy
there is a frontispiece, a lamp furnace,
consisting of a brass rod, fastened to a
piece of metal, furnished with rings of
different diameters, and thumb screws to
raise or lower the lamp and rings when
in use. By this furnace evaporation,
digestion, solution, sublimation, distillation
and other processes, which
require a low temperature, may be
performed.</p>

<p>And in the second volume there is a
frontispiece representing a portable
universal furnace, made of strong
wrought iron plates and lined with
bricks bedded in fire-proof loam. The
height of the furnace is two feet. The
body of the furnace is elliptical. There
are three openings in front of the furnace,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
one above the other, furnished with
sliding doors, and fitted with stoppers
made of crucible ware.</p>

<p>Both pieces of apparatus represent a
marked advancement. They were evidently
exceedingly useful. By their
means it was possible to execute excellent
work.</p>

<p>It would repay one to examine with
care the various American text-books
on chemistry, beginning about 1770 and
continuing down to 1830. There would
arise a picture before one's mind of the
successive steps in the development of
chemical apparatus, and again, the
knowledge derived from the presentation
of chemical theory and data would be
refreshing and inspirational. It is to
be hoped that the time is not far distant
when some library, public or university
library, will go to the trouble of gathering
the American texts on Chemistry for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the period just alluded to. It is not
likely that an alcove filled with this literature
would be largely patronized, yet
it would be possible for the enthusiast
on the development of chemistry in this
country to collect from such a source
a great deal of valuable material which
might be presented with profit to the
rising generation of American chemists.</p>

<p>Cutbush had little leisure during the
year 1813, as he was engaged with the
duties of the College and was conducting
popular lectures on an extended
scale. It was necessary for him to invite
his friend, Dr. George F. Lehman,
to assist in the various demonstrations.
They emphasized not only the theory
but the practice of chemistry with its
application to the useful arts. Their
experiments were numerous and were of
such a character as to appeal to the
general public. The course offered by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Professor Cutbush and Dr. Lehman was
remunerative. It is said the cost of
tickets for ladies was $5.00 and those
for gentlemen $8.00.</p>

<p>In addition to the devotion of Cutbush
to these didactic courses in chemistry,
he spent much time in a literary
way. One of the best-known publishers
of the city announced the purpose of
printing the <i>American Artist's Manual</i>
under the editorship of Cutbush. The
advertisement stated&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To manufacturers, however, who
are presumed to be interested in practical
knowledge the value of such works
is greatly diminished by the multiplicity
of theories, technical terms and complicated
processes which they in general
contain. It is, therefore, unnecessary
to expatiate on the advantages to
be derived from such a publication as is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
now proposed in the present work.
While it is intended to embrace most of
the Arts and Manufactures, particular
attention will be paid to those of agriculture,
brewing, bleaching, dyeing in
its various branches, the manufacture
of glass, pottery and all others
which the situation of our country
renders obviously of primary concern
and importance."</p></div>

<p>This extensive and helpful publication
appeared in 1814 in two octavo volumes
of more than 600 pages each. The
reader should note that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The price to subscribers will be $7.00
in boards or $8.00 substantially bound,
payable on delivery. Those who procure
subscriptions of nine copies and
become accountable for their payment
shall be entitled to one copy for
their trouble."</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>The book was dedicated to Benjamin
Smith Barton. No title of any kind
appears after the author's name, indicating
that he had probably by the year
1814 severed his connection with all his
educational projects in Philadelphia.
In the preface the author speaks of</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Having devoted the greater part of
his life to chemical pursuits."</p></div>

<p>Glancing through these volumes the
impression made upon the reader was
that the author had read widely in the
sciences, but particularly in his favorite
science, chemistry. The book is really a
popular dictionary of chemical technology.
While it is sparsely illustrated,
early forms of chemical glassware are
pictured. From these may be gathered
the story of the gradual development
of very useful apparatus, for example,
such as is used in various kinds
of distillation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>That Cutbush had probably ceased
his professional duties by the year 1814,
as has just been hinted, is further emphasized
on noting that he was appointed
Assistant Apothecary General
in the U. S. Army on the twelfth day of
August in the year 1814. What his
duties as such may have been has not
been discovered. It would not be fair
to call it a radical change in position,
but it was a change which necessitated
Cutbush giving more thought and attention
to pharmacy, which in his earlier
career was a secondary subject, but in
which he was so proficient that he attracted
to himself the attention of leading
men in medical circles. He was in
Philadelphia, prosecuting his duties as
late as the year 1819. It is known that
during this period he was attached to
the Northern Division of the Army.</p>

<p>In 1820 Dr. James Lovell, Surgeon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
General of the Army, suggested to General
Thayer, Superintendent of the
Military Academy at West Point, that
Cutbush be appointed Chief Medical
Officer at the Academy and Post of
West Point. In this capacity he served
for seventeen months, when he became
Acting Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy
in the Academy. The first
lecture in his new position was delivered
October 9, 1820. In a sense, it marked
the beginning of a new career for Cutbush.
He resumed teaching duties, but
gave himself more particularly to the
study, not only of gunpowder, which
never ceased to be interesting to him,
but to explosives of higher character,
and in this latter field he reached his
greatest eminence and may confidently
be regarded as a pioneer in it.</p>

<p>Just before leaving Philadelphia, in
the year 1820, Cutbush wrote Benjamin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Silliman at some length on an improvement
of the Voltaic electrical lamp. It
was an ingenious modification and constituted
the first contribution made by
Cutbush to the <i>American Journal
of Science</i>.</p>

<p>But, returning to his life at West
Point, it may be observed that in 1822
he contributed his second article to the
<i>Journal of Science</i>, which did not appear
in print, however, until 1824. This
article related to the composition and
properties of the Chinese fire and the
so-called brilliant fires. It was very interesting.
It displayed a thorough and
wide knowledge of pyrotechnics with
which Cutbush, in previous years, had
been gradually familiarizing himself.
At one point he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Most if not all the compositions
used in fireworks, including military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
fireworks, were more the result of the
labours of the artisan who was neither
controlled by fixed principles nor by a
knowledge of the effects and properties
of bodies and of the systematic experiments
of the chemist, and yet in consequence
of some fortuitous and repeated
trials we find that he has been successful,
and moreover has amassed a body
of facts which we may reasonably infer
may either be rendered more perfect by
knowledge or improved upon by the
exact aid of chemical science."</p></div>

<p>Here is every proof of his purpose to
apply his understanding of chemical
principles and his own experience to the
solution of pyrotechnic problems, for
he continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Pyrotechnics is at present considered
under two heads, namely, fireworks
for exhibition and military fireworks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
The latter is undoubtedly the most useful,
as it embraces a variety of propositions
calculated for attack and defence
both for naval and land service."</p></div>

<p>Almost simultaneously there appeared
in the same <i>Journal of Arts and
Science</i> another contribution by Cutbush,
entitled</p>

<p class="center">REMARKS CONCERNING THE COMPOSITION
AND PROPERTIES OF THE GREEK FIRE</p>

<p>In the light of recent events and the
use of all sorts of chemical bodies for
warfare and destruction it will not be
uninteresting to introduce here a few
paragraphs from this remarkable contribution.
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Greek fire was invented by Callinicus
of Heliopolis, a town in Syria,
who used it with so much skill and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
effect during a naval engagement that
he destroyed a whole fleet of the enemy,
in which were embarked 30,000 men.</p>

<p>"It appears that in the reign of
Louis XV, a chemist of Grenoble, Dupre
de Mayen, discovered a composition similar
in effect to the Greek fire of Callinicus,
which was exhibited at Brest, and
proved successful, but the preparation
was kept secret. The original Greek
fire was used in 1291, and also in 1679....
Writers have defined it to be a
sort of artificial fire, which burns with
increased violence when it mixes with
water.... That it was a liquid composition,
we may infer from the modes of
using it, which were several. It was
employed chiefly on board of ships, and
thrown on the vessels of the enemy by
large engines. It was sometimes kindled
in particular vessels, which might be
called fire ships, and which were introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
among a hostile fleet. Sometimes
it was put into jars and other vessels,
and thrown at the enemy by means of
projectile machines, and sometimes it
was <i>squirted</i> by soldiers from hand
engines, or blown through pipes. This
fire was also discharged from the <i>foreparts
of ships</i> by a machine constructed
of copper and iron, the extremity of
which is said to have resembled the <i>open
mouth</i> and <i>jaws</i> of a lion or other animal.
They were painted, and even
gilded, and were capable of projecting
the liquid fire to a great distance.</p>

<p>"... John Cameniata, speaking
of his native city, Thessalonica, which
was taken by the Saracens in the year
904, says that the enemy threw fire into
the wooden works of the besieged, which
was blown into them by means of tubes,
and thrown from other vessels....
This proves that the Greeks, in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>beginning
of the Tenth Century, were no
longer the only people acquainted with
the art of preparing this fire, the <i>precursor
of our gunpowder</i>. The Emperor
Leo, who about the same period wrote
his <i>Art of War</i>, recommends such engines,
with a metal covering, to be constructed
in the foreparts of ships, and
he twice afterwards mentions engines
for throwing out Greek fire.... For
many centuries the method of making
this dreadful article of destruction was
lost; but it has just been discovered by
the librarian of the elector of Bavaria,
who has found a very old Latin manuscript
which contains directions for
preparing it.</p>

<p>"... On the subject of incendiary
and other military fireworks, the
French have certainly laid the foundation
for the very preparations now used
by the British, for the formul&aelig; for such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
preparations may be traced to the
French service....</p>

<p>"The Moors were in possession of the
secret for preparing the Greek fire in
1432, according to the testimony of
Brocquire. Bertrandon de la Brocquire
was in Palestine in 1432 as counsellor
to the Duke of Burgundy. He was present
at Barrat during one of the Moorish
celebrations. 'It began,' he remarks,
'in the evening at sunset. Numerous
companies scattered here and there were
singing, and uttering loud cries. While
this was passing, the cannon of the
castle was fired, and the people of the
town launched into the air "<i>bein haut
et bein loin, une maniere de fue plus gros
fellot que je veisse oncques allume</i>."
They told me they made use of such at
sea, to set fire to the sails of an enemy's
vessel. It seems to me that it is a thing
easy to be made, and at a little expense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
it may be equally well employed to burn
a camp or a thatched village, or in an
engagement with cavalry to frighten
their horses. Curious to know its composition,
I sent the servant of my host
to the person who made this fire, and
requested him to teach me his method.
He returned for answer, that he dare
not, for that he should run great danger
were it known; but there is nothing a
man will not do for money. I offered him
a ducat, which quieted his fears, and he
taught me all he knew, and even gave
me the moulds in wood, with the other
ingredients, which I have brought to
France.' ... When Constantinople
was attacked, the Emperor Leo burnt
the vessels or boats, to the number of
one thousand eight hundred, by means
of the Greek fire.... Its composition
was kept secret at Constantinople,
pretending that the knowledge of it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
came from an angel to the first and
greatest of the Constantines, with a
sacred injunction not to divulge it under
any pretext, etc. It ... was kept
secret above 400 years ... was stolen
by the Mahometans, who employed it
against the Crusaders. A knight, it appears,
who despised the swords and
lances of the Saracens, relates, with
heartfelt sincerity, his own fears at the
sight and sound of the mischievous
engine that discharged a torrent of fire.
'It came flying through the air, like a
winged, long-tailed dragon, about the
thickness of a hogshead, with a report of
thunder, and the velocity of lightning;
and the darkness of the night was dispelled
by this deadly illumination. The
use of the Greek, or as it might now be
called the Saracen fire, was continued
to the middle of the Fourteenth Century,
when the scientific or casual compound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of nitre, sulphur and charcoal effected
a new revolution in the art of war, and
the history of mankind.' ... We
do not know of any imitation of the
original Greek fire having been used in
modern warfare, but have no hesitation
in believing that naphtha prepared as
already stated would in many cases
prove advantageous. It seems to be well
calculated for close naval combat, if the
object be to destroy the sails and rigging
of an enemy's ship. The rapidity
and extent of its combustion, added to
the circumstances of its peculiar properties,
that of resisting the action of
water in particular, contribute altogether
to this opinion."</p></div>

<p>The entire article from which these
excerpts have been made is worthy of
study, even at this late date. It is suggestive
and carries with it many historical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
references of value. The enthusiasm
of Cutbush for pyrotechnic
bodies is manifest in every line of
this publication.</p>

<p>About a year later (1823) Cutbush
discussed the formation of cyanogen in
processes not previously noticed. He
spoke of the appearance of this gas
in the putrefaction of animal and vegetable
matter, making the following
remarkable and in some respects
startling statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I believe it would be found that the
compound (carburet of azote) is the
basis of the miasmata which produces
malignant, bilious diseases....
Marsh miasmata are generally the cause
of intermittent fevers. Now under particular
circumstances of action may we
not admit the generation of carburet of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
azote or cyanogen, and if so, as it readily
unites with hydrogen, may it not be
the miasma which produces malignant
bilious fevers, since it is known that
hydrocyanic acid is destructive to animal
life and a most virulent poison?...
Miasmata of some kind are the
cause of yellow fever. For our part we
believe it to be carburet of azote, or of
some of its combinations, and of these
that with hydrogen, from its deleterious
character, seems to be the one."</p></div>

<p>Another observation made in this connection
was that cyanogen is produced
when charcoal is heated with nitric acid.
Cutbush stated that he placed charcoal
and nitric acid together in a retort and
subjected them to distillation, collecting
the product in Woulfe's bottles, after
which the resulting solutions were impregnated
with potash, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"common sulphate and persulphate of
iron introduced. The colour instantly
changed and became more or less blue,
proving the existence of the perferrocyanite
of iron and, consequently,
of cyanogen."</p></div>

<p>Having never met this method of preparing
cyanogen, experiments were
made in the writer's laboratory to verify
the statement. A blue, or what had the
semblance of a blue color, could be obtained
at the point given by Cutbush,
but just as soon as the solution was
acidulated, as is always done, the precipitate
disappeared and there was not
the slightest indication that Prussian
blue had been formed. Even after hours
of rest there was not a sign of it.</p>

<p>Association on the part of Cutbush
with the men of science in Philadelphia
during the first decade of the Nineteenth
Century led to an extension of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
his interest in science circles, so that
during leisure moments at West Point
(1824) he wrote of the following minerals
observed by him in and near
that place:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Molybdenite, kaolin, tremolite,
schorl, adularia, garnet, actinolite,
precious serpentine (remarkably elegant),
epidote and diallage."</p></div>

<p>Recently, attention has been called to
a volume by Cutbush entitled "Lectures
on the Adulteration of Food and Culinary
Poisons.... With a Means
of Discovering Them and Rules for Determining
the Purity of Substances."
It was published at Newburgh, N. Y.,
in 1823. The writer has never seen
this volume. His search for it has
been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Another publication was "A Synopsis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of Chemistry, Arranged Alphabetically,
Comprehending the Names, Synonyms,
and Definitions in that Science." New
York: E. Lewis, 1821. This book is also
exceedingly rare.</p>

<p>The real magnum opus of Cutbush
resulted in "A System of Pyrotechny"
(1825), which voluminous publication
did not appear until after his decease,
and then largely through the efforts of
his wife and former students in the
Cadet Corps, for, in <i>Silliman's Journal</i>,
this note appeared:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Mrs. Cutbush, widow of the late Dr.
Cutbush, of West Point, proposes to
publish by subscription a Treatise on
Pyrotechny by her husband, Dr. James
Cutbush.... By the reputation
which Dr. Cutbush sustained, as well as
by the ability which his elaborate treatises
on these subjects already published<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
in this journal display, there can be no
doubt that this posthumous work will
be worthy of the public patronage,
which we hope will be liberally bestowed."</p></div>

<p>Even to-day this publication stands
out pre&euml;minently and for years has been
referred to by artisans and by scientists.
Chapters dealing with military fireworks
have been seriously studied. In the light
of the violent fires, grenades, etc., used
in the late war the writings of Cutbush
become very fascinating. They show
that he truly blazed the way in this field.
In the introduction to this splendid volume
he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On this head, that of the application
of chemistry to pyrotechny, we claim so
much originality, as, so far as we know,
to have been the first, who applied the
principles of chemistry.... As this
subject, however interesting to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
theoretical pyrotechnist, cannot be
understood without a knowledge of
chemistry, it is obvious that that science
is a powerful aid to pyrotechny....
Viewing pyrotechny either as a science
or an art, there is undoubtedly required
in its prosecution much skill and practice.
The mere artificer or fireworker
by constant habit may understand, it
is true, how to mix minerals, prepare
composition, charge cases, etc., ...
but without a knowledge of chemistry he
cannot understand the theory....
Indeed, chemistry is indispensable
to pyrotechny."</p></div>

<p>Much time and thought were given
by Cutbush in the experimental development
of this particular subject in his
own laboratory. In reading upon
the subject he had collected a vast material
which was then put to crucial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
experimental tests. These, outside
of his teaching hours, occupied his
whole attention.</p>

<p>An outline of how the work in the
chemical department of the United
States Military Academy was conducted
will not be devoid of interest.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>First Year</i></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Theory and Experimental Chemistry.</span></p>

<p><i>Second Year</i></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Application of Chemistry to the
Arts, Manufactures and Domestic
Economy, constituting
along with Mineralogy the
second course.</span></p></div>

<p>Pyrotechny naturally was developed
quite extensively. Teachers of chemistry
will note with pleasure the questions
which Cutbush arranged for his
student corps, particularly those questions
which had to do with pyrotechny:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What is saltpetre? What is nitric
acid? What are the sources of saltpetre,
and how it is obtained? How is
it formed in nitre beds, extracted, and
refined? What circumstances are necessary
to produce nitre, and how does animal
matter act in its production? What
is the difference between the old and new
process for refining saltpetre? What
reagents are used to discover the presence
of foreign substances in nitre?
What are nitre caves? Where do they
exist? What are the nitre caves of the
western country, and how is nitre extracted
from the earth? What proportion
of nitre does the saltpetre of the
nitrate caves afford? What is the
theory of the process for extracting
saltpetre from nitrous earth, or nitrate
of lime? What is sulphur? How is it
obtained, and how is it purified for the
manufacture of gunpowder? Of what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
use is sulphur in the composition of
gunpowder? Does it add to the effective
force of gunpowder? What is charcoal?
What is the best mode of carbonizing

gunpowder? What woods are preferred
for this purpose? In the charring of
wood, what part is converted into coal,
and what gas and acid are disengaged?
What is the use of charcoal in gunpowder?
What is gunpowder? What

the combustion of gunpowder take
place? Can you explain why combustion
takes place without the
presence of a gaseous supporter of

the force of gunpowder? How would
you separate the component parts of
gunpowder so as to determine their proportions?
What are gunpowder proofs?
What is understood by the comparative
force of gunpowder? What are eprouvettes,
etc.? In noticing in the same
manner the preparations used for fireworks,
and for war, as the rocket, for
instance, the following questions were
propounded; viz., What is a rocket?
How is it formed? Is the case always
made of paper? What is the war
rocket? What is the composition for
rockets, and how does it act? What
particular care is required in charging
a rocket? What is the cause of the
ascension of rockets? What is the use
of the conical cavity, made in a rocket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
at the time it is charged, or bored out
after it is charged? How do cases
charged with composition impart motion
to wheels, and other pieces of fireworks?
What is understood by the rocket principle?
What is the rocket stick and its
use? Is the centre of gravity fixed, or
is it shifting in the flight of rockets?
How are rockets discharged? What is
the head of a rocket? What is usually
put in the head? Are all rockets furnished
with a head? What is understood
by the furniture of a rocket? How are
the serpents, stars, fire-rain, etc., forming
the furniture of a rocket, discharged
into the air, when the rocket has terminated
its flight, or arrived at its
maximum of ascension? What forms
the difference between a balloon, in fireworks,
and a rocket? As the balloon
contains also furniture, and is projected
vertically from a mortar, how is fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
communicated to it, so as to burst it in
the air? Is the fuse used, in this case,
the same as that for bombs, howitzers,
and grenades? What is the Asiatic
rocket? The fougette of the French?
In what siege were they employed with
success by the native troops of India?
What was the nature of their war-rocket?
What is the murdering rocket
of the French? Is the conical head hollow,
solid, blunt, or pointed? Why is
it called the murdering rocket? What
is the Congreve rocket? Is Congreve
the inventor or improver of this rocket?
What are Congreve rockets loaded or
armed with? In what part is the load
placed? Is the case made up of paper
or sheet-iron? What are the sizes of
Congreve rockets?"</p></div>

<p>In the introduction to "Pyrotechnics"
Cutbush remarked that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
consulted many authorities without
much advantage, finding the French the
most helpful. Of the English he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As respects the turtle torpedo and
catamarin submarine machines, it appears
that Bushnel claims the originality
of the discovery from the date of his
invention, although similar contrivances
had long ago been suggested. Fulton's
improvements, in the torpedo, are deserving
of particular attention, but it
is plain that the Catamarin of the English
is the same in principle and application
as Fulton's torpedo and that
Fulton deserves the merit of it."</p></div>

<p>The "System of Pyrotechny" bears
the ear-marks of much careful experimental
study. It is a most worthy contribution,
and is strong proof of the
dominating force in the mind of Cutbush,
namely, to make his science as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
widely useful as possible. Chemists
may justly take pride in this early contribution
in the application of chemical
principles.</p>

<p>The life story of Cutbush has now
been told. It is really the story of his
life activities, for regrettable as it is,
there does lack a picture of the man's
personality. The parents of James
Cutbush were Edward Cutbush and
Anne Marriat. The father was a stone-cutter
or carver. To these good people
were given four children: Edward, born
in 1772; Ann, in 1782 (who died in
1798); William, born in 1785, and
James in 1788. Edward became prominent
as a naval surgeon, while William
graduated from West Point in 1812,
and attained eminence as an engineer.</p>

<p>Indeed, at an early age, William was
a midshipman in the United States
Navy, and was taken prisoner by the
Algerines at the time the frigate Philadelphia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
ran aground in the harbor of
Tripoli, from which he was released
after two years' confinement in prison,
and returned to the United States,
when he became a cadet in the Military
Academy.</p>

<p>James Cutbush must have been a man
of mark among his neighbors&mdash;as indicated
by sundry positions of trust which
he held. Further, he must have been a
favorite with the Cadet Corps at West
Point, where he was buried. His tomb
there bears this inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sacred to the memory of Dr. James
Cutbush, Member of the American
Philosophical Society, Late Surgeon,
U. S. Army and Professor of Chemistry
at the U. S. Military Academy, West
Point, N. Y., who departed this life
December 15, 1823, aged 35 years.
An honourable tribute of respect from
his grateful pupils."</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<p>The work of Cutbush was of the genuine
pioneer character, and enriched the
annals of American chemistry. While
it would be delightful to know more of
the man, cruel fate compels us to be
content with the estimate, brief though
